## How it all started?

Habour and Scott Serenata in 1991 published a paper called "How to Timestamp a Digital Document" 

you can find that paper in this <a href="http://www.anf.es/pdf/Haber_Stornetta.pdf">Link<a/>

If you look through the papers, you read through it, you'll find that the concepts of what now we call a block chain and all of the or most of the features and ideas behind the blockchain actually are present in that paper.

## So what actually is a Blockchain?
  
  In layman term, A blockchain is a growing chain of Blocks. 
  
According to wikipedia A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
  
 A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.
Today the most popular cryptocurrency  “Bitcoin” runs on blockchain technology and that is one reason why this cryptocurrency is becoming popular with each passing day. Because of the transparency in each step of a transaction in blockchain technology, now most of the businesses are adopting it globally.
