## #1 Â· Intro To Solidity

Solidity is the main programming language for writing smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. It is a contract-oriented language, which means that smart contracts are responsible for storing all of the programming logic that transacts with the blockchain. It's a high-level programming language that looks a lot like JavaScript, Python, and C++. It's designed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is hosted on Ethereum Nodes that are connected to the blockchain. It is statically typed, and supports inheritance, libraries, and more! In short, it has all the capabilities that you need to build industrial-strength blockchain applications.

We're going to use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write all of the code in this tutorial. The remix is a browser-based IDE that allows you to write, compile, deploy smart contracts! It has a lot of nice features like persistent file storage! We'll use Remix so that we don't have to download any developer tools or install anything to get started.

Let's start by creating a new file to write some Solidity code.

<img src="https://www.dappuniversity.com/solidity-tutorial/new-file.png" alt="New Solidity File" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Let's create a new file named `MyContract.sol`. On the first line of this file, we'll declare the version of the solidity programming language we want to use:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
```

Now we can declare the smart contract like this:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract MyContract {
    // ...
}
```

A smart contract is a piece of code that gets executed on the Ethereum blockchain. It functions somewhat like an API microservice on the web that is publicly accessible to everyone. All of the code of the smart contract is visible to the public, and we can allow anyone connected to the network to call functions on the smart contract.



First, we'll program a simple "storage" smart contract that will be able to:

- Store a value
- Retrieve this value



We'll start by creating a way to store a string value in the smart contract like this. We'll do that with a variable called `value`. Solidity is a statically typed language, so we must first specify the data type when declaring the variable like this:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract MyContract {
    string value;

}
```

This variable is called a "state variable" because it actually persists data to the blockchain. Anytime that we set this value, the string will be saved to the blockchain! It will get written to storage, not memory. This variable also has special scope, as it is accessible to the entire smart contract unlike a local variable which is only accessible inside of functions, and will not persist after the function has been called. 



Now let's create a function to read this value from storage. We'll start by declaring a function called `get()` with the function keyword like this:

```
function get() {
    // ...
}
```

Now we'll return the value from the state variable with the `return` keyword like this:

```
function get() {
    return value;
}
```

Now we'll set the "visibility" of this function to `public` so that anyone connected to the blockchain can call it (not just from within the smart contract code itself):

```
function get() public view {
    return value;
}
```

Finally, we'll specify the return value `string` for the function:

```
function get() public view returns(string) {
    return value;
}
```

Awesome! Now we have a way to read this value from the smart contract. I'll show you how to do this after we compile it momentarily. Before we get there, let's create a way to set this value from outside the smart contract. We'll create a `set` function like this:

```
function set(string _value) public {
    // ...
}
```

We simply created a function that accepts a `_value` argument of `string` type. This function is also publicly visible so that anyone connected to the blockchain can call it. Now let's actually update the smart contract `value` like this:

```
function set(string _value) public {
    value = _value;
}
```

Here we simply assigned the passed in `_value` and assigned it to the `value` state variable. Notice that `_value`, prepended by an underscore is simply a local variable. This is a common convention when writing Solidity code, as well as other languages.

Now let's set a default value for the `value` state variable. We'll do that inside the smart contract constructor function like this:

```
constructor() public {
    value = "myValue";
}
```

We first declare the constructor function with the `constructor` keyword. This function is run only once, whenever the smart contract is deployed. It also must have the `public` visibility.



Now that's the complete source code! Let's see how we can compile and deploy this smart contract. First we'll set the compiler version in the right hand side of your browser. We'll choose version `0.4.25` to compile this code.

Now, let's choose the environment. I'll select the JavaScript virtual machine, which will give us a simulated blockchain inside our browser.

Now we can easily deploy this with a single click of a button!

Awesome! You've just deployed the smart contract. You can interact with the smart contract by calling its functions below, with the form that was generated based upon the smart contract's interface.

<img src="https://www.dappuniversity.com/solidity-tutorial/functions.png" alt="Smart Contract Functions" style="zoom:67%;" />

First, let's read the value. Let's click the `get()` function. You should see the default `"myValue"` that was set in the constructor.

Now let's update the value with the `set()` function. Add a new value inside the form field, just make sure that you wrap it in quotation marks like this: `"New Value"`. Now run it! Now read the value again. It should changed to `"New Value"`!

You might have noticed this transaction window below the text editor. This is a complete list of all the transactions on this virtual blockchain. Remember, the Etherum blockchain is made up of bundles of records called "blocks" which are "chained together" to make up the public ledger. The basic units of all these blocks are transactions. You're seeing them listed here below. You can click the "down" arrow to see all details of the receipt.
