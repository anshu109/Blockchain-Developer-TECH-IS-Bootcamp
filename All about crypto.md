The world of crypto is full of technical jargon that can confuse even the savviest technology ninja. Bitcoin introduced the concept of crypto-economics and paved the way for the creation of many blockchain platforms. Before we dive deep into how a blockchain works, let’s understand what cryptoeconomics is and the underlying concepts behind a blockchain

## Encryption:
Encryption is a process of converting your message into code so that only authorized parties can access it. 
## Decryption:
Decryption is reversing the encryption process so that the message can be converted to the original message.
## Key:
A small amount of information is required to induce the output of the cryptographic algorithm
## Cipher: 
The mathematical function, i.e. a cryptographic algorithm which is used to convert plaintext to ciphertext.
## Cryptography:
This is using the techniques of encryption and decryption to send and receive messages.

The word Cryptography is made up of two ancient greek terms, Kryptos having meaning “hidden” and Graphein having meaning “to write”.
## Cryptocurrency:
This is using cryptography to fit the needs of a digital asset
## Cryptoeconomics: 
This is the combination of cryptography and economics to provide a platform to pass digital assets.

According to the developer of Etherium, Vlad Zamfir,

“Cryptoeconomics is a formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in a decentralized digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterization of these protocols.”

The blockchain technology runs on the principles of cryptoeconomics
