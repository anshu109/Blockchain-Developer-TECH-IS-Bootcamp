# All about crypto

The world of crypto is full of technical jargon that can confuse even the savviest technology ninja. Bitcoin introduced the concept of crypto-economics and paved the way for the creation of many blockchain platforms. Before we dive deep into how a blockchain works, let’s understand what cryptoeconomics is and the underlying concepts behind a blockchain

## Encryption:
Encryption is a process of converting your message into code so that only authorized parties can access it. 
## Decryption:
Decryption is reversing the encryption process so that the message can be converted to the original message.
## Cryptography:
This is using the techniques of encryption and decryption to send and receive messages.
## Cryptocurrency:
This is using cryptography the same way as the earlier SSL or video example but specifically to fit the needs of a digital asset
Cryptoeconomics: This is the combination of cryptography and economics to provide a platform to pass digital assets.

According to the developer of Etherium, Vlad Zamfir,

“Cryptoeconomics is a formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in a decentralized digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterization of these protocols.”

The blockchain technology runs on the principles of cryptoeconomics
